# South Jersey Python and Web Developer's Group Presentation:  Spark

This repo contains the markdown that I used to create my presentation, the PDF that was generated from that markdown,
some example Jupyter Notebooks, and a docker-compose file for running the examples.

If you'd like to run these examples at home, simply:

* Have Docker installed
* Have docker-compose installed
* Run `docker-compose up` from within this project's root directory
* Watch the console output.  You'll eventually be given a URL to navigate to.  This will run navigate you to the web
interface for Jupyter.  Navigate into the `presentation` directory to find the notebook and data.
